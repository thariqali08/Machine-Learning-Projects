## Dynamic Pricing Strategy using Python
In a dynamic pricing strategy, the aim is to maximize revenue and profitability by pricing items at the right level that balances supply and demand dynamics. It allows businesses to adjust prices dynamically based on factors like time of day, day of the week, customer segments, inventory levels, seasonal fluctuations, competitor pricing, and market conditions.

To implement a data-driven dynamic pricing strategy, businesses typically require data that can provide insights into customer behaviour, market trends, and other influencing factors. So to create a dynamic pricing strategy, we need to have a dataset based on:
- historical sales data,
- customer purchase patterns,
- market demand forecasts
- cost data
- customer segmentation data, 
- and real-time market data.

I found an ideal dataset to create a Dynamic Pricing Strategy based on the example we discussed above. This is [dataset](https://github.com/thariqali08/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Dynamic%20Pricing%20Strategy/dynamic_pricing.csv) and [source code](https://github.com/thariqali08/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Dynamic%20Pricing%20Strategy/Dyn_strat.ipynb)
