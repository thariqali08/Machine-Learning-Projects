## Dynamic Pricing Strategy using Python
In a dynamic pricing strategy, the aim is to maximize revenue and profitability by pricing items at the right level that balances supply and demand dynamics. It allows businesses to adjust prices dynamically based on factors like time of day, day of the week, customer segments, inventory levels, seasonal fluctuations, competitor pricing, and market conditions.

To implement a data-driven dynamic pricing strategy, businesses typically require data that can provide insights into customer behaviour, market trends, and other influencing factors. So to create a dynamic pricing strategy, we need to have a dataset based on:
- historical sales data,
- customer purchase patterns,
- market demand forecasts
- cost data
- customer segmentation data, 
- and real-time market data.

I found an ideal dataset to create a Dynamic Pricing Strategy based on the example we discussed above. This is [dataset](https://github.com/thariqali08/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Dynamic%20Pricing%20Strategy/dynamic_pricing.csv) and [source code](https://github.com/thariqali08/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Dynamic%20Pricing%20Strategy/Dyn_strat.ipynb)


## MNIST Digits Classification with Machine Learning
MNIST digits dataset is a vast collection of handwritten digits. This dataset is used for training image processing systems. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, this dataset is already available in this Scikit-learn library, we will be using this dataset by importing it from the Scikit-learn library.

This is how you can solve the problem of handwritten digits classification with Machine Learning using Python. This is Project [source code](https://github.com/thariqali08/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/MNIST%20Digits%20Classification/model_clss.ipynb)

## Stress Detection
Stress detection is a challenging task, as there are so many words that can be used by people on their posts that can show whether a person is having psychological stress or not, this is how you can train a machine learning model to detect stress from social media posts. People often share their feelings on social media platforms. Many organizations can use stress detection to find which social media users are stressed to help them quickly.

This dataset contains various mental health problems shared by people about their life. Fortunately, this dataset is labelled as 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no stress and 1 indicates stress.  This is Project [dataset](https://github.com/thariqali08/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Stress%20Detection/dataset.csv) and [source code](https://github.com/thariqali08/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Stress%20Detection/stress_det.ipynb)

## Anomaly Detection in Transcation
Anomaly detection in transactions means identifying unusual or unexpected patterns within transactions or related activities. These patterns, known as anomalies or outliers, deviate significantly from the expected norm and could indicate irregular or fraudulent behaviour. Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in various businesses, especially those dealing with financial transactions, online activities, and security-sensitive operations.

We can follow a systematic process to address the challenge of anomaly detection. We can begin by collecting and preparing transaction data, ensuring its accuracy and consistency. Then, we can find patterns in the data to find anomalies and use specialized anomaly detection algorithms like isolation forest to detect anomalies. This is Project [dataset](https://github.com/thariqali08/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Anomaly%20Detection%20in%20Transcation/transaction_anomalies_dataset.csv) and [source code](https://github.com/thariqali08/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Anomaly%20Detection%20in%20Transcation/anom_det.ipynb)
