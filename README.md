## Dynamic Pricing Strategy using Python
In a dynamic pricing strategy, the aim is to maximize revenue and profitability by pricing items at the right level that balances supply and demand dynamics. It allows businesses to adjust prices dynamically based on factors like time of day, day of the week, customer segments, inventory levels, seasonal fluctuations, competitor pricing, and market conditions.

To implement a data-driven dynamic pricing strategy, businesses typically require data that can provide insights into customer behaviour, market trends, and other influencing factors. So to create a dynamic pricing strategy, we need to have a dataset based on:
- historical sales data,
- customer purchase patterns,
- market demand forecasts
- cost data
- customer segmentation data, 
- and real-time market data.

I found an ideal dataset to create a Dynamic Pricing Strategy based on the example we discussed above. This is [dataset](https://github.com/thariqali08/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Dynamic%20Pricing%20Strategy/dynamic_pricing.csv) and [source code](https://github.com/thariqali08/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Dynamic%20Pricing%20Strategy/Dyn_strat.ipynb)


## MNIST Digits Classification with Machine Learning
MNIST digits dataset is a vast collection of handwritten digits. This dataset is used for training image processing systems. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. You can download this dataset from various data sources on the internet. But as this dataset is already available in this Scikit-learn library, we will be using this dataset by importing it from the Scikit-learn library.

This is how you can solve the problem of handwritten digits classification with Machine Learning using Python. This is Project [source code](https://github.com/thariqali08/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/MNIST%20Digits%20Classification/model_clss.ipynb)
